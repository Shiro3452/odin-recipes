        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Bulgogi (Korean: 불고기; /bʊlˈɡoʊɡiː/ bool-GOH-gee;[2] from Korean bul-gogi [pul.ɡo.ɡi]), literally "fire meat") is a gui (Korean-style grilled or roasted dish) made of thin, marinated slices of meat, most commonly beef, grilled on a barbecue or on a stove-top griddle. It is also often stir-fried in a pan in home cooking. Sirloin, rib eye or brisket are frequently used cuts of beef for the dish. The dish originated from northern areas of the Korean Peninsula, but is a very popular dish in South Korea, where it can be found anywhere from upscale restaurants to local supermarkets as pan-ready kits</p>

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p> Kimchi is a traditional Korean dish dating back to over 3,000 years ago.
            Traditionally, Kimchi contains napa cabbage (Chinese cabbage), radish, carrots,
            salt, garlic, fish sauce, chili powder and scallions. There are many different ways 
            make Kimchi, but this is the most common and basic way
        </p>

        <p>Kimich is fermented and contians lots of vegetables. In turn, this makes it a very
            convinent and healthy dish. You may eat it as a side dish or put it on other foods or even
            use it for cooking. Kimchi is rather spicy and has a salty taste, it also has a rather umami taste
            due to the spices that are added during the fermentation
        </p>
